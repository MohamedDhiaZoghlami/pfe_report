Reliability:
Using some error handling technics and through consistent testing and monitoring we ensured that our application is reliable.

Scalibility :
The application is designed to accommodate both vertical scaling (adding more resources to a single server) and horizontal scaling (distributing load across multiple servers) so it will be always scalable.

Availability:
We ensured that the application is highly availalbe by adding load balancers and using cloud services to deploy the application.

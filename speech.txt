Good afternoon, esteemed members of the jury, my family, friends, and honored guests.
Today, I stand before you to present the culmination of years of hard work, dedication, and passion, a project that I believe holds the potential to change the way businesses identify, nurture, and capitalize on opportunities.
Ladies and gentlemen, the project I am about to introduce to you is the "Design and Development of a Business Opportunity Management Application."

Today, I am excited to demonstrate my project to you and share the results of my hard work. I will walk you through the key features, starting by the hosting company, to the problem that we were trying to fix, defining our solution, the design process from requirements and specifications, the technical environment to the final design and architecture, finally i will show you the final result of this work in the realization part.

It is with great pleasure that I reserve this page as a symbol of gratitude and deep appreciation for all those who have contributed to the completion of this work. This experience has taught me a lot, especially how to manage stress during challenging times and how to persevere regardless of the situation.

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the management of the company 'Progress Engineering' for giving me this wonderful opportunity to undertake my final internship with them.

I would also like to thank Mr. Mabrouk Zhili and Mr. Lassaad Saidani, my supervisors, for their valuable advice and availability. I have been well guided and have always been able to rely on my professor, who never ceased to encourage me and have confidence in me.

I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep gratitude to the entire educational and administrative team at ESPRIT for all the efforts they have made to provide us with quality education.

Lastly, I extend my most sincere thanks to the members of the jury for agreeing to evaluate this work. I hope that they find in it the qualities of clarity and synthesis they are expecting.

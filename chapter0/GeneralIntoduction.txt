In recent times, the landscape for IT companies has undergone a notable shift, marked by increasing challenges in securing new projects and clients, as well as the struggle to retain their existing customer base. The rapid evolution of technology, coupled with a highly competitive market, has led to a proliferation of IT service providers, intensifying the battle for limited opportunities. Clients now demand not only exceptional technical expertise but also a keen understanding of their specific industry needs and challenges. This necessitates a constant investment in upskilling employees and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies, which can strain resources. Moreover, as project scopes expand and become more complex, maintaining effective communication, meeting deadlines, and delivering superior quality have become paramount, further testing the capacities of IT companies. Amidst this, retaining existing customers has become equally daunting, with loyalty hinging on consistently surpassing expectations and offering ongoing value. As a result, IT companies find themselves in an intricate dance of innovation, adaptability, and customer-centricity to navigate this arduous landscape.

In this End-Of-Studies project, I will try to explain how Progress Engineering is responding to these changes and how we have developed a software that addresses all of these challenges.

The report is structured as follows: At first, I defined the project scope from presenting the hosting company to the problem statement, our proposed solution and its goals as well as laying out the working methodology. Throughout the second chapter, I specified the functional and non-functional  requirements alongside identifying the main actors and refining the product global use case. After that, in the 3rd chapter, I wrote about the technical environment (Runtime environment, Frameworks, libraries, tools etc...) that we used during the internship to develop the application. Following that, in the 4th chapter, I defined the software architecture, the Database design and gave some use case scenarios. Finally, the 5th chapter is dedicated to showcase the project from development to production and a realization of the final application.

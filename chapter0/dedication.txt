No matter the words chosen, I will never be able to express to them my sincere love. To the Eternal, Allah, the Almighty for having helped me reach the end of my studies, for giving me the strength to survive, as well as the courage to overcome all difficulties.
To My Dear Parents, no dedication could express my respect, eternal love, and consideration for the sacrifices you have made for my education and well-being. I thank you for all the support and the love you have shown me since my childhood, and I hope that your blessings always accompany me. May this modest work be the fulfillment of your many expressed wishes, the result of your countless sacrifices, although I can never repay you enough. May Allah, the Most High, grant you health, happiness, and a long life and ensure that I never disappoint you.
To all my Friends, thank you immensely for your help, your time, your encouragement, your assistance, and support. To all my teachers, I dedicate this work. To all those who have contributed directly or indirectly to the completion of this work, may Allah grant you health and prosperity.
